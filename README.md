Health and Lifespan Analysis in Power BI
This project analyzes life expectancy data by examining factors such as healthcare,
immunizations, mortality, finances, and social conditions to identify key predictors of
lower life expectancy. The analysis aims to answer important questions, including the
impact of healthcare expenditure, infant and adult mortality, lifestyle habits, and
schooling on lifespan. It also explores the relationships between life expectancy and
habits like smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as the role of immunization
coverage. The study provides valuable insights to help countries prioritize areas for
improvement and effectively enhance the overall life expectancy of their populations.
